    <h4>Burma Bridge</h4>
<p>The Burma Bridge structure has two parallel ropes - one above the other - strung from poles / trees,
at a height of 25 feet.
Participants are divided into teams. At one time, two participants will climb the structure from two
opposite ends using ladders and walk across the ropes to the center of the structure. They will walk
on one rope while holding the other one at shoulder / head height for support.&nbsp;
<p>The participants will be secured with harnesses and the guiding / belay ropes will be handled by
instructors.</p>

<h4>Valley Crossing</h4>
<p>In this adventure sports activity, a rope is tied across a river on the two river banks. The participants
cross the river one-by- one.&nbsp;
Each participant is harnessed and the belay / safety rope is in the hands of the instructor. The
participant is attached to the primary rope with the help of a carabiner - the participant is parallel to
the rope. The participant then has to use his / her hands to pull himself / herself to the other end of
the river. This activity also takes care of enhancing motor-skills as well as courage.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Hiking</h4>
<p>Hiking&nbsp;is the act of walking. When referred to as an activity it is most commonly as a day trip that
requires little planning and organization. It’s basically just walking on trails. It can involve taking a
trail to the top of a mountain, or just a gentle prairie trail that winds along a river or creek.</p>

<h4>Rappelling</h4>
<p>Rappelling is the technique of the abseil (or rappel) method of roping down or descending down a
fixed rope on a rock-face or mountain side. The participants are secured safely to a harness and
belay rope, which are handled by an instructor.&nbsp;
The participants walk down backwards parallel to the ground at a 90 degree angle to the rock-face
while the rope is let out slowly from their hands. The other end of the rope is secured on the top of
the rock-face with the instructor. This is an adventure sports activity that helps develop courage,
motor-skills, co-ordination &amp; balance.</p>
<p>There are quite a few variations of Rappelling - Face Forward, Back Forward, Overhang etc.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Flying Fox</h4>

treetop to treetop? &nbsp;Come to Mashobra Greens this summer and find out!
Flying Fox is an awesome, exhilarating experience.&nbsp; There is nothing like it in the world! &nbsp;We
utilize&nbsp;qualified staff &amp; trainer for our Flying Fox activities, in the camp.

<h4>Tree Zumaring</h4>
<p>Imaging having to pull yourself up a tree or any other high point with the help of a rope, with nothing
else to help you get up there! No branches to take support from, no hand or foot hold to seek
leverage from, nothing but the raw strength of your muscles to get you to achieve the height you
wish to attain.. Every inch of height gained will be a test of your strength and stamina – an
achievement in its entirety! Jumaring is one activity that will get you to prove it to the world and to
yourself that you have the power to do almost anything.It will help you prove your metal like no
other.</p>
<p>Jumaring will be the ultimate test of your strength and stamina. Imagine climbing&nbsp;on tree vertically
from ground to top branch without support of its trunk.&nbsp; A picture speaks more than thousand words
in the same way the experience of&nbsp;Jumaring is bigger than&nbsp;lifting a truck on your hands. Probably for
first time you will&nbsp;feel your weight and its true impact.</p>
